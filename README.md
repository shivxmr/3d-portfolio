Do give this repo a star if you like it!


If you wish to use this website, then fork the repo and make changes in src/constants/index.js according to your needs.
Also most importantly, for the email service, you should create your own account on Email JS and change the public key, template id and service id in src/components/Contact.jsx for the email to come on your account.
